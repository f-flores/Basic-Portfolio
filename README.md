# Basic-Portfolio
#### Francisco Fabian Flores

## Description
This project contains a basic personal portfolio page. The website consists of three sections: brief bio, portfolio projects, and contact information. There is also a "social media" section which has links to personal github, linkedin and stackoverflow content.

## Approach to project
### HTML
First, I defined three html pages to get the basic structure of each page. The "header" section of each page contains a box with my name, a navigation bar with three links to the sections of the website, a height of 100 pixels with the specified background color.
The "main content" of each page contains two boxes. The width, per the requirements, is 960 pixels wide. Currently, the website is not responsive.
The "footer".

### CSS

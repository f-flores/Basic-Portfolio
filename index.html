        <p>
            My name is Francisco Fabian Flores. Born in Jersey City and raised in Elizabeth, NJ, 
            I can appreciate the cultural diversity of our state and country and the breadth of knowledge of its people. 
            In my youth, I practiced Tae Kwon Do and played little league baseball. I also was 
            a volunteer tutor in my community.
            I have always enjoyed programming. In college, I majored in Computer Science.
            For a few years, post graduation, I worked as computer programmer. Then, I started
            a small cybercafe business, which -from a technical aspect- involved mostly but not 
            only network administration.
            In an effort to learn new technologies and seek a fruitful
            career in software development, I recently took it upon myself to join a coding 
            bootcamp and become a web developer. The challenging Rutgers Coding Bootcamp 
            curriculum will surely assist in attaining this goal.
